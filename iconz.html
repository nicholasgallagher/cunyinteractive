    <h2 class="iconzh2">Who are the stakeholders in this battle, and what do they have to lose?</h2>
  </div>

  <ul> 
    <li class="iconzli">Hundreds of private companies across the country parse through court records, find the names of renters who have been involved in housing-related court cases, and sell this information to landlords. When someone's name shows up on a list, it can take up to five years to get back off, even if they won their case against a landlord who wronged them. In the meantime, it's oftens nearly impossible to be approved for housing, even if all other indications show that they would be able to pay their bills.
    </li>

    <li class="iconzli"> Now, New York City lawmakers want to make it more difficult for landlords to rely on tenant blacklists when deciding on potential renters. But many landlords say they rely on these lists for protection against risky renters, and that getting rid of them altogether would give landlords less opportunity to understand the financial situation of their tenants.

        <p class="iconzp"> <b>Tenants:</b> Being included on a tenant blacklist can cause headaches, anxiety and financial hardship for years to come, say tenants' rights advocates. Even in instances where tenants successfully defend themselves against landlords who have been accused of wrongdoing, the renters' participation in the case can be enough to dissuade future landlords from taking any risks. Additionally, the blacklists often do not indicate cases in which renters were forced to leave an apartment in an emergency. Renters hope that the city's new legislation will allow them to protect themselves against exploitative landlords without the fear of being put at an inherent disadvantage for doing so.

        <p class="iconzp"> <b>Lawyers:</b> Lawyers have played a significant role in advocating for the end of tenant blacklists in New York City. James Fishman, a private attorney who defends tenants' rights, said the proposed bill is a step in the right direction but might not be enough to protect renters, since they will have few options to defend themselves if their rights are violated. In other words, the bill doesn't ensure that tentants can fight back if their landlord has violated blacklist laws. Fishman said, "that what tenants really want and what they really need, however, is not a lawsuit against a landlord. What they want is an apartment." According to Fishman, in the face of continued legal ambiguity, an unconventional technique might offer the best protection for tenants who are involved in housing court cases: requesting to remain anonymous in all court proceedings related to housing issues.

        <div>
        <p class="iconzp"> <b>Politicians:</b> City council members like Ben Kallos, who represents areas of the Upper East Side and Roosevelt Island, says that the current laws have created a system "where even if you win, you lose." Some members of the city council hope to pass legislation that mirrors laws that have already been passed in the state of New York. Those laws would make it more difficult for landlords to rely on blacklists when making decisions about who to rent to. The proposed bill would do relatively little to punish landlords who continue to rely on blacklists for their rental decisions. As the bill currently stands, punishment would come in the form of $100 fines, per unit per month, which gradually rise if the landlord fails to comply.

        <p class="iconzp"> <b>Property Owners:</b> The Community Housing Improvement Program, an organization made up of over 4,000 rent-stabilized property owners across New York, argued that the bill would offer one less tool for property owners to understand the nuance behind a renter's financial background. CHIP's Communication Director, Michael Johnson, said that his constituents fear the legislation could encourage landlords to focus on specific benchmarks like a tenant's credit score rather than taking a holistic approach to understanding an applicant's history. For example, if a landlord makes an exception for a particular candidate who she feels would be capable of making payments despite having a low credit score, she may be accused of discrimination for overlooking candidates whose credit scores were higher, according to Johnson.
