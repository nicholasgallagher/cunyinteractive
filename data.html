<p class="datap"> The homeless population seeking shelter in New York City tends to balloon during the Winter months, according to census data from the Department of Homeless Services. Shelters in New York City often find greater difficulty balancing resources during the coldest periods of the year. That's because even a marginal increase in shelter populations can make it more challenging for shelters to keep up with demand, according to Mario McMichael, the Director of Programs at Partnernship for the Homeless, a homelessness advocacy group. 
</p>

<p class="datap"> The population rise can partly be attributed to outreach teams becoming more active during the Winter months, McMichael said. Teams target subways and other areas of the city where people facing homelessness tend to congregate to escape the cold. But many homeless shelters do not have systems in place to help residents find permanent housing, which can sometimes lead to a population build-up.
</p>

<p class="datap">"A lot of times, it's just exit into another shelter, and then the cycle starts all over again in terms of the time-period that that family can now stay in the new shelter." McMichael said.  "So they just kind of bounce from shelter to shelter."

More generally, the homeless population in shelters has consistently risen across all seasons since 2015. The population peaked in January 2019 when over 61,200 people stayed in homeless shelters. McMichael says the rise is likely due to affordability issues across the city that effect people who are already vulnerable of becoming homeless.

<p class="datap">
"They either haven't been homeless before or haven't been homeless in a very long time, but they're living precariously on the edge," McMichael said. "And then when the landlord increases the rent by five percent or ten percent in an unregulated unit, boom, that's the thing that lands them into the shelter."
