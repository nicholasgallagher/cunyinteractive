	  <h1 class="maph1">Minimum Wages in the South Remain Stagnant</h1>

<p class="mapp">Over the past decade, advocates across the country have fought for state-wide minimum wage increases. They've been successful in states located in the Northeast and along the West Coast &#8212 29 states currenly have minimum wages that are above the federal standard. Meanwhile, minumum wages across many states in the South have remained entirely stagnant.
</p>

<p class="mapp">A Bureau of Labor Statistics 2018 <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2018/pdf/home.pdf">report</a> found that five percent of Louisiana's hourly earners and four percent of South Carolina's hourly earners made at or below the federal minimum wage. The percentages of those two Southern States are the highest in the entire country. Advocates in those states can't rely on nation-wide changes either, since federal regulations haven't been changed since 2009, when the hourly minimum was raised to $7.25 per hour.

<p class="mapp">Emma Hutchens, a program coordinator at Just Economics, a living wage advocacy group based in Western North Carolina, said that one reason for the minimum wage disparity in the Southern states is that common misconceptions persist about people who live in rural areas. Hutchens said that critics often argue that, "folks who live in metropolitan areas deserve to be paid a higher wage because cities are expensive." Yet, Hutchens explains that although there are some differences in the cost of living for people residing in smaller towns, the current minimum wage is still far too low to accomoadate workers in those communities. "These are all wage issues that people run into regardless of whether they live in a city or in a rural place," Hutchens said.
</p>

<p class="mapp">Hutchens also pointed out the complex legal challenges that prevent many Southern states from changing their current minimum wage mandates. In North Carolina, for example, it is illegal to change the minimum wage in a particular city or county, so reform at a local level is virtually impossible. Just Economics has found other ways to promote living wages in North Carolina such as awarding special licenses to local businesses who vow to pay all of their employees a wage that allows them to meet all of their basic needs.
</p>

<p class="mapp">Others suggests that raising the minimum wage could have damaging effects on the economy and might cause some businesses to cut jobs that are currently being occupied by low-wage workers.
</p>

<p class="mapp">Several southern states have minimum wages on the books that are below the federal standard. In those cases, employers are still required to abide by the federal law. However, there are a few exceptions that allow employers to pay a worker below the federal minimum wage.
</p>

<p class="mapp">For example, in most states, employers can pay workers with physical or mental disabilities <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/5/3/17307098/workers-disabilities-minimum-wage-waiver-rock-river-valley-self-help">far below</a> the federal minimum wage, with prior approval from the Department of Labor, as previously reported by Vox. In order to be elibgible for this exemption, employers need to prove that the worker's speed or efficiency would be compromised by the the task he or she is required to perform. Certain student training programs are also exempt from abiding by the federal minimum wage. 
</p>

<p class="mapp"> Hutchens insists that the best solution for leveling out geographical disparities is an update to the federal law, which would ensure that people who are working full-time jobs can be financially independent. Until then, Just Economics and organizations across the South are continuing to promote businesses that choose to pay their workers a living wage, regardless of the laws in a particular region.
